## Usage

[This password generator](https://joey-sisk.github.io/PasswordGenerator/) is designed to accept user input regarding password length, and what character types the user wants to include. The user is required to keep the password over 8 and under 128 characters and if they either enter a number outside of those bounds or enters a non number input they will be prompted to try again. If they enter a number with a decimel point it will be rounded down. The password will choose from a pool of characters selected by the user and randomly deliver a password for them to use.
